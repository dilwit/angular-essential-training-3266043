- Core components
    - Components, Services
    - Directives, Pipes
    - Data Binding, Event Handlers
    - HTML Module, Forms Modules
    - Routing, Animation
    - Testing
    - Building for Production
    - CLI
      - ng build
      - ng serve
      - ng generate
      - ng ling
      - ng test
    - Dev Tool - browser ext

- Angular Modules
  - Angular modules represent a collection of closely related files that work together. This might include things like components, services, or even pipes. They help Angular figure out how all the parts of your application work together.
  - app.module.ts

- Angular @Component
  - consists of
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Typescript
    - Component selector
  - Component can be considered as one section/page of the app. (ie: Loan Application Details)
  - Components can also have hookups 
 
- Reference variables and data binding
  - Binding - There are three common types of data binding in Angular, event binding, property binding, and interpolation.
      - Event binding
        - Event binding lets us quickly assign actions to DOM events like keyup and click
      - Property binding
        - Property binding lets us dynamically assign values to the attributes on a standard HTML element or to properties on an Angular component.
      - Interpolation
        - Interpolation lets us display dynamic content as text in the UI.
